# fspec Command - Kanban-Based Project Management

IMMEDIATELY - run this command (fspec is already installed locally, so just run it):

fspec --sync-version 0.9.3

IF the output from this command is an error, asking you to run the "fspec configure-tools" command, RUN THAT FIRST BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS YOU WERE GIVEN.

THEN - run this command and load it completely in your context, as it is CRITICAL TO REMEMBER:

fspec bootstrap

YOU MUST RUN THOSE COMMANDS AND WAIT FOR THEM TO FINISH BEFORE CONTINUING ANY FURTHER.
