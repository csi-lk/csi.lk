    <h2>Writing & Thinking</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a personal space for thinking and writing. Some notes are published intentionally over time.
      The content is shaped by work in engineering, leadership, systems, and life.

    <h2>SilkOS</h2>
    <p>
      SilkOS is my private personal operating system—a space to capture ideas, notes, links, and conversations,
      and gradually turn them into structured knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of what lives there stays private. Occasionally, pieces are intentionally published here once
      they're clear enough to stand on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      SilkOS is not a product. It is not publicly accessible. It is an internal system that occasionally
      publishes outward.
