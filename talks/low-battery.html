<li>Low Battery: Why You're Always Mentally Drained (And How to Fix It)</li>
<li>A talk by Callum Silcock</li>
</ul>
<p>This presentation was written using obsidian slides which is why the markdown looks a little weird, see attached PDF output and notes of every slide.</p>
<p>Everything underneath &quot;note&quot; below are speaker notes to remind me what to talk about</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction - Principal Engineer at ANZ</li>
<li>15+ years building and scaling dev teams</li>
<li>Today: why you feel brain dead at 3pm and what to do about it</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/low-battery/teams-call.png" alt="teams call"></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>Story time - Baby is coming</p>
<ul>
<li>October 3rd 2023</li>
<li>I'm working from home and dialed into my standup at 10am with a new manager that's just started at ANZ a few weeks prior</li>
<li>Why am I working from home? Because my wife is 41 weeks pregnant and due at any moment</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/pregnant-wife.png" alt="pregnant wife"></p>
<p>note:</p>
<ul>
<li>She comes into the room and exclaims &quot;I'm pretty sure i'm in labor&quot;</li>
<li>Ok, great! We have a plan for this, I do a quick brb on the call and get her to sit down on the couch and set her up</li>
<li>I run back to the call and tell everyone &quot;my baby is coming&quot; and put the slack status on, quickly book the next 2 weeks as OOO and cancel all my meetings</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/slack-notifications.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>But in the time it takes me to do this suddenly I have 6 new slack notifications</p>
<ul>
<li>I start looking at them</li>
<li>OMG congrats!!</li>
<li>Could you quickly send me the document so I can work on it while you're away</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hold on... this isn't important... back to the task at hand</p>
<p>I close the laptop go through to the other room to sit with my wife</p>
<p>Ok, gotta call my Dad as I need him to pick up the dog.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/iphone-notifications.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open my phone and see a wall of notifications
<ul>
<li>Do a quick scan</li>
<li>ummm more slack notifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gotta Focus
<ul>
<li>Call dad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Great he's going to pick up the dog</p>
<p>Ok back to my wife, what do I need to do now, right</p>
<p>Start timing the Contractions</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/rate-this-app.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>I open the contraction timer app, click &quot;start contraction&quot; and immediately get a &quot;Could you rate this app out of 5 stars&quot;</p>
<p>The most important thing in my life was happening that day and I was consistently bombarded with things trying to steal my attention</p>
<p>Things getting me to switch focus</p>
<p>Things that ultimately didn't matter</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/notification-hell.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<ul>
<li>We're constantly being pulled away from what currently matters
<ul>
<li>Notifications from other applications</li>
<li>I bet in the time i've been talking you've had a bunch of notifications already pop up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every buzz, ping, popup stealing our focus</li>
<li>And there's a hidden cost we're not seeing</li>
</ul>

note:</p>
<h1>Your brain has a battery</h1>
<ul>
<li>Think of cognitive capacity like your phone battery</li>
<li>Start the day at 100%, take it off charge to wake up</li>
<li>Every task drains it a little</li>
<li>Sleep recharges it</li>
<li>Simple, right? But here's where it gets interesting'</li>
<li>It's not just WHAT you do that drains battery, it's HOW you do it</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/different-batteries.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Some brains drain faster than others</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you're neurodivergent, especially ADHD, cognitive battery starts smaller and drains faster</li>
<li>This isn't a limitation, just how your brain may work</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/60-percent-capacity.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>We're all running at 60% capacity</h1>
<ul>
<li>Research shows most professionals spend 20-40% time on meaningful work</li>
<li>The rest: switching between tasks, managing interruptions, cognitive overhead</li>
<li>But, It's not <em>just</em> about time</li>
<li>There's a deeper problem happening in our brains</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/switching-cost.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>The Switching Cost Trap</h1>
<ul>
<li>Every time you switch between tasks, brain pays cognitive tax</li>
<li>Your Brain has to stop, context switch, reload new task</li>
<li>Like closing one app and opening another
<ul>
<li>creates a processing overhead</li>
<li>creates errors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/office-distraction.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>It's not just online</h1>
<ul>
<li>Environmental factors also play a large part</li>
<li>In the office we have
<ul>
<li>Physical interruptions - &quot;shoulder tapping&quot; - people coming to your desk
<ul>
<li>Cognitive drain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overhear conversation? Brain needs to filter that out
<ul>
<li>More cognitive drain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the worse, peripheral vision constantly triggered by movement
<ul>
<li>Like someone walks behind my monitor?</li>
<li>Even more Cognitive drain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/home-distraction.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>And it's not just in the office</h1>
<ul>
<li>Working from home we also have forced cognitive switches
<ul>
<li>Seeing the laundry that you still need to put on or the dishes in the sink</li>
<li>Doorbell rings from Amazon delivering a package</li>
<li>My dog that wants to bark at everyone that walks past my house</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/draining-battery.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>The compound effect</h1>
<ul>
<li>All of these compound together</li>
<li>One or two switches? No big deal</li>
<li>But we're switching tens to hundreds of times per day</li>
<li>Email, Slack, meetings, phone calls, different projects</li>
<li>Each switch compounds</li>
<li>By afternoon, cognitive battery running on fumes</li>
<li>Don't know why because each individual switch felt harmless</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/fast-vs-slow.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Fast vs slow battery drain</h1>
<ul>
<li>Focus on a single meaningful item drains our battery slower</li>
<li>Deep work - when you're in flow state - barely drains battery at all
<ul>
<li>You can do this all day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But responding to 12 different slack threads, or something like, I dunno, suddenly needing to do a ton of estimations and elaboration sessions?
<ul>
<li>Kills your battery quick</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/team-batteries.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>What can I do?</h1>
<ul>
<li>As a manager you have a major impact on your teams energy</li>
<li>You can implement strategies to help them preserve their batteries</li>
</ul>
<p>But first...</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/oxygen-mask.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>First: put on your own oxygen mask</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start with you
<ul>
<li>Look at your own situation first</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By implementing strategies to help your own battery, you will learn how to help your staff</li>
<li>Can't preserve other people's cognitive batteries if yours is constantly dead</li>
</ul>

<p>4 quick fixes
3 strategies</p>
<p>Ok... so, I'm an engineer and love giving people actionable takeaways from my talks, so, here's some immediate things to roll out</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/notification-triage.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Quick fix #1: Notification triage</h1>
<ul>
<li>As we discussed notification is context switch</li>
<li>Phone buzzes, brain automatically processes &quot;is this important?&quot;</li>
<li>Even if don't check immediately, you've paid cognitive tax</li>
<li>Be ruthless and cut those out</li>
<li>Email / slack don't need real-time responses</li>
<li>You can batch these into dedicated times</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/clean-workplace.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Quick fix #2: Physical workspace</h1>
<ul>
<li>Your environment shapes your cognitive load</li>
<li>In office, position yourself to minimize peripheral movement</li>
<li>headphones mean &quot;don't interrupt&quot;
<ul>
<li>try messaging on slack first</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At home, dedicate space for work
<ul>
<li>Brain learns to associate that space with focus mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/deep-work.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Quick fix #3: Calendar blocking</h1>
<ul>
<li>Most people are calendar reactive</li>
<li>Let meetings fill their day, try to do real work in gaps</li>
<li>Flip this</li>
<li>Block time for most important work first, let meetings fill around it</li>
<li>Two hours is sweet spot - long enough to get into flow, short enough to maintain energy</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/morning-vs-afternoon.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Quick fix #4: Deep vs Shallow scheduling</h1>
<ul>
<li>Cal Newport's concept - not all work is created equal</li>
<li>Deep work requires your full cognitive battery</li>
<li>Shallow work can be done when running low</li>
<li>Schedule accordingly</li>
<li>Do most important thinking when battery is full</li>
<li>Save email for when running on fumes</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/fixes-summary.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>Holding slide for all 4 quick fixes</p>
<p>Ok lets move on to strategies</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/team-comms.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Strategy #1: Communication protocols</h1>
<ul>
<li>Set a culture with your and stakeholders on communication norms</li>
<li>Not everything needs immediate response</li>
<li>Most &quot;urgent&quot; things aren't actually urgent</li>
<li>Create clear protocols about what warrants interrupting someone's deep work vs what can wait</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/meeting-buffer.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Strategy #2: Meeting hygiene</h1>
<ul>
<li>Meetings are major battery drains, especially back-to-back</li>
<li>Build in transition time so brain can context switch properly</li>
<li>Protect blocks of time that are meeting-free for your team</li>
<li>Please have an agenda - aimless meetings are cognitive torture</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/daily-graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Strategy #3: Energy management</h1>
<ul>
<li>About becoming more conscious of your cognitive state</li>
<li>When are you sharpest? When do you crash?</li>
<li>Plan accordingly</li>
<li>Know you have demanding afternoon? Take it easier in morning</li>
<li>Big presentation? Schedule recovery time after</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/strategies.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>But how am I going to remember these?</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/tools.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Your toolkit</h1>
<p>note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created companion website with tools to help implement these concepts</li>
<li>At link csi.lk/battery</li>
<li>Includes all of the strategies i've talked about, the slides and the AI generated images</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/checklist-step.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Start tomorrow</h1>
<ul>
<li>Don't try to implement everything at once - recipe for failure</li>
<li>Pick one thing from today's talk and commit to trying it tomorrow</li>
<li>Once that becomes habit, add another</li>
<li>Remember, small changes compound</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/golden-battery.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Your cognitive battery is precious</h1>
<ul>
<li>Final thought - cognitive capacity is your most valuable resource</li>
<li>You don't expect your phone to last for days on end without charging</li>
<li>Don't do the same with your brain</li>
<li>Protect your cognitive battery, it will serve you better in everything you do</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/low-battery/questions.png" alt=""></p>
<p>note:</p>
<h1>Questions?</h1>
<p>csi.lk/battery</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love to hear your questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't forget to check out companion resources online</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly I'm going to finish early to give you some time back to do the context switch</p>
