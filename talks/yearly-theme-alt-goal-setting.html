<h2>An alternative to goal setting</h2>
<p>Another <em>CodingWithCallum™️</em> Session</p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>I'm trying a new presentation format where I have heaps of slides and text, I have AI generated all the images and some a hilariously bad, so be sure to call out the horrible ones in the chat</p>
<p>This presentation was written using obsidian slides which is why the markdown looks a little weird, see attached PDF output and notes of every slide.</p>
<p>Everything underneath &quot;note&quot; below are speaker notes to remind me what to talk about</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/resolution.png" alt="the word resolution lit up with fireworks in the background"></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>How many people made a new years resolution this year? (ask for hands to go up)</p>
<p>Put your hand down if it's already failed</p>
<p>Clock strikes 12 and I declared in 2025 I want to drink a lot less...</p>
<p>Then had friends from Scotland arrive and I asked them what was the main thing they wanted to do in Melbourne they said:</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/callum-4pines-brunswick.jpg" alt="a man with an incredible beard in front of a sign that reads 4 pines welcome to brunswick"></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>&quot;We want to check out as many breweries as possible&quot;</p>
<p>... so, that resolution was quite short lived... (yes I'm up for going to the pub after work too)</p>
<p>But, you know what makes me feel better?</p>
<p><em>It's not just me that has already hit this problem...</em> many people share where i&quot;m currently at</p>
<p>Let's look at Gyms in 2 numbers:</p>
<hr>
<h1>12.5%</h1>
<h1>80%</h1>
<p>notes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.glofox.com/blog/6-new-years-resolution-gym-statistics-you-need-to-know/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source - glofox</a></p>
<p>12.5% of yearly new gym signups are in January</p>
<p>80% of these sign ups cancel their membership before mid year</p>
<p>Or.. as the old joke goes...</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/gym-to-bar.png" alt="a bar that has gym equipment on the left hand side with people working out and some people drinking beer on the right"></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>I'm going to open a place that's a gym for two months and becomes a bar for 10 months and call it &quot;resolutions&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/aud-lang-line.png" alt="a graph showing the share of americans who keep their new years resolution, starting at 100 percent in january and ending at 40 percent in december"></p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>So why is this such a common experience for everyone?</p>
<p>Because new years resolutions suck</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/resolutions-suck.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>A significant amount of people set goals just before the end of the year then bail out of that goal as soon as they hit an issue. Like, random example, friends from Scotland coming to town</p>
<p>So what does work?</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/theme.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>&quot;hey it's the name of the talk!&quot;</p>
<p>Give yourself a theme!</p>
<p>Hey Callum, what are you talking about?</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/pouring-beer.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>So, the whole idea is;</p>
<p>Instead of setting yourself up to fail with,</p>
<p>“I'm going to stop drinking next year,”</p>
<p>or</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/read-books.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to read one book a week, at least”</p>
<p>We can set an abstract theme something like 'Year of health' or 'Year of Reading'</p>
<p>Now if that sounds a bit broad, that's kind of the point.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/trend-line.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>What we're worried about here is the trend line going up</p>
<p>If the trend is going in the right direction, so are you.</p>
<p>Or as James clear puts it</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>If you get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ <strong>Atomic Habits</strong> by James Clear</p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Sidebar: There's many presentation James Clear has on youtube about his book if you're not up for reading it that i'd suggest checking out</p>
<p>Ok, how does a theme help?</p>
<hr>
<h1>122</h1>
<p>notes:</p>
<p><a href="https://ementalist.com/how-many-decisions-do-we-make-each-day/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source - Ementelist</a></p>
<p>You make on average around 122 &quot;informed&quot; decisions day to day</p>
<p>Informed as in &quot;active&quot; decisions, like &quot;what should I eat for lunch&quot;</p>
<p>Our Theme gives us a decision framework to fall back on for every one of these</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/packed-lunch.png" alt="packed lunch"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>For example if my theme is &quot;Year of health&quot; and I get asked whether I want to go to the pub for lunch.</p>
<p>I now have a framework to help me make that choice</p>
<p>The &quot;Health&quot; choice is maybe to eat my packed lunch in the fridge</p>
<p>Or if I do go to the pub maybe I can just get a salad...... or maybe a pot over a pint....</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/salad-vs-pub.png" alt="salad-vs-pub"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>The point here is for each of these 122 decisions, using our theme as a framework will push our</p>
<p>Trendline upward</p>
<p>Ok an example</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/bought-a-house.png" alt="house buying"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>In 2023 (hey it's me!)</p>
<p>I'd just moved jobs (to my current one at ANZ), bought a house (which required a bunch of work) and my wife and I were talking about having children</p>
<p>I needed to focus on getting my life in order</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm going to do <code>n</code> things per <code>t</code> time</p>
<p>note:</p>
<p>So instead of setting up my goals of &quot;I'm going to do <code>n</code> things per <code>t</code> time&quot; like</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I'm going to Exercise <code>n</code> times a week&quot; or</li>
<li>&quot;Cook at least <code>n</code> meals a week&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/stability.png" alt="A big rock with a pint of beer resting on it"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>I set my theme as the &quot;Year of Stability&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/nursery.png" alt="nursery"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>So I made the branching path choices and ended up with a fully painted nusery (pictured here), solar panels, a bunch of new recipes and a new hatrid for weight lifting etc.</p>
<p>But what was really interesting is that stability started to take on more meaning, I started focusing on strengthening my relationships with friends, putting dedicated &quot;couple time&quot; in my calendar and changing my work approach to take myself out of critical paths</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/navigating-beer.png" alt="A ship navigating a sea of beers instead of waves"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Because the point is: A good theme can't fail, it's a broad direction you set to navigate your life</p>
<p>Whether that's your personal life <em>or</em> work life</p>
<p>Sidebar; yes that is a ship sailing a sea of beer, just wanted to make that clear</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/drunk-writing.png" alt="A drunk person writing a diary"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Ok, how do we make this practical... aka</p>
<p>&quot;Wow Callum this is fantastic, I don't really understand but I like the beer part of it, how do I get started?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h1>(My Theme)</h1>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<h2>Ideal Outcomes</h2>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Our basic template consists of 3 parts</p>
<p>The Theme, The Why and Outcomes</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Step 1. Is actually.. the &quot;why?&quot;, what would I like to change, improve upon</p>
<p>So, we're my favourite prompt is &quot;what do I really <em>want</em> to change and why?&quot;</p>
<p>and be honest! this is for you</p>
<p>For example</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm spending too much time on my phone doomscrolling Tiktok and my concentration is all over the place. This is my year to reduce my screen time and get back into reading and I really want to find a community that I can share my progress with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>I might have been a little <em>too</em> honest when coming up with this example</p>
<p>(read why)</p>
<p>Great we've got our why so lets work backward to a broad &quot;directional&quot; phrase that resonates</p>
<hr>
<h2>Year of Reducing screen time</h2>
<h2>Year of Focus</h2>
<h1>Year of Reading</h1>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Spend time on coming up with your theme, iterate on this, talk to friends and family bout it</p>
<p>&quot;Year of reducing screen time&quot; to specific
&quot;Year of Focus&quot; is good but I want it to be about reading
Well... yeah</p>
<hr>
<h1>Year of Reading</h1>
<h2>Ideal Outcomes</h2>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>&quot;Year of Reading!&quot;</p>
<p>Ok, Now we can define what our &quot;Ideal Outcomes&quot; would be</p>
<p>These is where we pick high level deliverables that are easily achievable</p>
<p>Essentially they're going to act as a guide for us to refer to if we need.. and don't worry you can change them later</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ideal Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read 12 new books</li>
<li>Join a local book club</li>
<li>Less than 2 hours of screen time per day</li>
<li>Develop consistent bedtime routine</li>
<li>Update my progress on Goodreads</li>
</ul>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Well I wanted to read more so I'd like to read a bunch of books</p>
<p>I wanted to find a community, let's try good reads and ANZ has a book club I could probably join</p>
<p>I was worried about TikTok maybe I set screentime filtering on that</p>
<p>You guys get it...</p>
<p>If you don't hit the outcomes throughout your year, that's ok... it's progressing that's the point.</p>
<p>This is something to refer to if you need but don't set it as gospel</p>
<p>Ok, another quick example</p>
<hr>
<h1>Year of Health</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to improve my sleep and general health so I can keep up with my daughter rather than being tired all the time. This year I want to focus on good nutrition, building more active time into my day and sleeping better</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete 10k run</li>
<li>Meal prep lunches most days</li>
<li>Clothes fit better</li>
<li>Pain in shoulder reduced</li>
<li>Less screen time before bed</li>
</ul>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>You get it</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/boardroom-beer.png" alt="A boardroom setting with many people in suits drinking beer"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>this feels very life-coachy how does it relate to work?</p>
<p>because I guarantee your theme will also be applicable to your work</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/drown-notifications.png" alt="A developer drowning in a sea of notifications while holding a beer"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>My &quot;year of reading&quot; could consist of learning new technical concept, spending more time in PRs, even writing more documentation (hah just kidding)</p>
<p>&quot;Year of health&quot; could include things like setting specific blocks of focus time, changing your commute to cycle to work, even reducing work anxiety by finally wrangling the millions of notifications you get</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/beer-theme.png" alt="The word theme with a bunch of pint glasses full of beer around it"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>it's broad enough to give you that framework to make those decisions</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>congrats! we've set our theme! can we get some smiley faces in the chat</p>
<p>talk over?</p>
<p>well I have some tips and tricks that help really solidify it</p>
<p>Tip 1:</p>
<hr>
<h1>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</h1>
<hr>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Mi-hai can't-pronounce-his-last-name</p>
<p>He's the guy who recognised and named the psychological concept of &quot;flow&quot;</p>
<p>We may refer to it as &quot;in the zone&quot;, head in the game etc.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/thsLNYzSkeo" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A nice source for this part is a youtube short</a>)
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia on Mihaly</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/rig-poker.png" alt="A man cheating at the game of poker hiding cards in his sleve sitting at a poker table with beer"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>He talks about a concept that I love which is:</p>
<p>&quot;Rig the game so you are always feeling some sort of progress&quot;</p>
<p>the most motivating thing is to give yourself a tangible sense of progress toward your goals</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/todo.png" alt="A todo list with hundereds of items that have been completed, with a beer on the side "></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>what does this mean in practice?</p>
<p>break the outcomes down into the smallest pieces and check them off constantly</p>
<p>to go back to our &quot;year of reading&quot; example from before</p>
<hr>
<h1>Year of Reading</h1>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Ideal Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read 12 new books
<ul>
<li>Read a chapter of a book
<ul>
<li>Read 1 page of a book</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>We can break our &quot;read books&quot; outcome into tiny pieces</p>
<p>So maybe my todo list every day is... read 1 page of a book. man it feels good to tick off todo list items</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/break-it-down.png" alt="Break it down in big letters with a man drinking beer celebrating on the right hand side"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>So tip 1 is &quot;Break it down&quot;</p>
<p>And tip 2 is pretty straightforward</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/yearly-theme/written-on-fridge.png" alt="Written on fridge"></p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Write your theme down somewhere you're going to see it every day</p>
<p>The fridge, the toilet, your desk... whatever works</p>
<p>You want to keep it front of mind</p>
<p>Side note: you get to see my amazing handwriting here and photos of my family with Santa that I haven't yet taken down</p>
<p>Ok... talk is finally over... so... to summarise</p>
<hr>
<h1>Pick a theme</h1>
<h1>Start with &quot;Why?&quot;</h1>
<h1>Ideal outcomes</h1>
<h1>Break it down</h1>
<h1>Write it down</h1>
<h5>Beer?</h5>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>(read above)</p>
<hr>
<p>https://www.themesystem.com/</p>
<p>https://www.relay.fm/cortex/162</p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>A lot of these concepts come from different places that i've mashed together but the main person to check out is CGP Grey if you have time</p>
<p>They have a physical journal which honestly you don't need but is great if you like paper</p>
<p>They also spend 2 hours talking through their themes every year so if you'd like someone to go into excruciating detail about examples check out these links</p>
<p>Ok, lastly the most important number</p>
<hr>
<h1>44</h1>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>Is the number of beers that appeared today</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<hr>
<p>Example Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if I get sick of my theme can I change it?</li>
<li>How does this apply to creating new habits?</li>
<li>When can we go for a beer?</li>
