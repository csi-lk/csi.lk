<p>TL;DR: Using a rigid commit format with emoji means I limit myself to a commit per ‘thing’, it also allows me to parse my commits quickly.</p>
<h2>What’s in a commit?</h2>
<p>Everybody has had that sinking feeling of losing minutes, hours or days worth of work due to forgetting to save, as a hangover from this I find myself constantly committing changes to effectively ‘save the state’.</p>
<p>Because of this my projects usually end up with hundreds if not thousands of commit messages, I need a way to quickly parse what the commit messages relate to.</p>
<p>Expanding on Sparkbox's original idea for the case of <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic commit messages</a>  I am forcing myself to a rigid commit format and replacing ‘type’ with a specific ‘emoji’.</p>

<h2>What emojis have you been using?</h2>
<p>Personally I like:</p>
<pre><code>⚙️ - Anything build / settings related
✨ - New feature
🐛 - Bug fix
💅 - Styling or display change
🛂 - Testing related
🌏 - SEO Related
📝 - Updating content
🗑 - Removing things
🔨 - Dependency related
</code></pre>
<p>The format that <a href="https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gitmoji</a> uses as it’s defined well, it also comes with <a href="https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CLI</a>  to get up and running quickly.</p>
<p>If you’d like to use your own emoji style you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Emoji keyboards’
<ul>
<li>Windows <code>WIN + .</code></li>
<li>Mac <code>CONTROL+OPTION+SPACE</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commitizen</a> script
<ul>
<li>Also gives the added bonus of enabling ‘smart commits’</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever your format is it doesn’t matter as long as it’s uniform.</p>
