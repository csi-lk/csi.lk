<p>I feel it's important to set goals every year and keep track of them to see how you are progressing. I have a few goals that I set for myself every year, some of which are personal and some of which are professional.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<h3>Buy a home ✅</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get pre-approval for mortgage ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>We were so happy to buy a 3 bedroom home in 2022, we had been looking for a while and finally found a place that we loved. We are now in the process of renovating the house and making it our own.</p>
<h3>Get a dog ✅</h3>
<p>We welcomed Bax into our lives early 2022, he is a Golden Retriever mixed with a Poodle (Groodle) that just turned 1 years old. He is a very energetic dog and loves to play with his toys and go for walks.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<h3>Be promoted to Senior Staff Engineer ✅</h3>
<p>Which I achieved by putting a case forward with my manager then promoted while at Hopin</p>
<h2>Health</h2>
<h3>Quit drinking for Feb ✅</h3>
<p>Ok it's the shortest month but I wanted to try quitting drinking for a period of time</p>
<h3>20 plasma donations ✅</h3>
<p>I donate plasma fortnightly with the red cross, I have been doing this for a few years now and I still maintain is the easiest form of community service that exists, you sit in a chair, drink a milkshake and save someones life</p>
<h3>Cycle 200 days ✅</h3>
<p>I love cycling, I have am electric bike that I use to get to work and I also use it to go for rides on the weekend. I have been tracking my cycling on Strava / Apple Health and I managed to hit 200 days in 2022</p>
<h3>Start weight training ✅</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do 10 sesions with friend to learn ✅</li>
<li>Sign up to gym ✅</li>
<li>Start 3+ day / week routine ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I have to force myself to go to the gym most times I really enjoy watching the numbers tick up over time of the weight gains</p>
