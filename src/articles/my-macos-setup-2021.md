I am fortunate enough to have purchased a new M1 Max Macbook Pro with 64gb ram, here's the software i'm using with it

# Browsers

## Brave (main)

My current preferred browser, a good mix of Chrome functionality but without the tracking.

I turn off all tracking / crypto stuff by default and am using the 'sync chain' functionality to have the same setup between devices
