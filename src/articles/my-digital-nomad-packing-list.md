As some of you know my wife and I spent 6 months travelling across South East Asia while living nomadically through Airbnb's and Hostels in 2018, recently due to COVID-19 we've been forced to live nomadically in the UK due to being abandoned by the Australian Government and having our flights continuously cancelled.

Here's what i'm currently travelling with:

## Backpack

Most important part is finding a backpack that works for you, it needs to strike a balance between functionality, style and comfort.

I'm rocking the [Riut - X35 (35 litre)](https://www.riut.co.uk/collections/all-secure-riutbags-best-backpacks-2021/products/riutbag-x35-black-large-laptop-backpack) as it allows me to use it as a normal backpack day to day or as a travel bag when transiting.

## Clothes

- 6 \* ASColor Scoop Neck (Shadow) T-shirts
- 1 \* Wooly Merino T-shirt
- 6 \* Bonds micro-fibre underwear
- 3 \* Merino socks
- 1 \* Generic H&M Gym Shorts
- 1 \* 'nice' shorts
- 1 \* Nudie Jeans (slim)
- 1 \* No name belt I bought while travelling
- 1 \* Timberland boots
- 1 \* Allbirds sneakers (woollen, that are super light and don't require socks)
- 1 \* Nice 'going out' shirt
- Leather Jacket
- Uniqlo fold up puffer jacket

Packed into two packing cubes and 1 shoe bag

## Tech

- Nintendo switch
  - I also swapped the dock for a travel one that looks [like this](https://www.shapeways.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/travel-dock-nintendo-switch-3D-printed-840x624.jpg)

- Small HDMI cable
  - For using airbnb / hotel tv's with the laptop (netflix) and switch
- Kindle Paperwhite
- Backup laptop and phone battery
- All the dongles and cables

## Misc

- Aeropress Go portable coffee maker
  - I drink too much coffee and spending Â£3 x 3 a day would bankrupt me
- Sunglasses

  - Helps you secure your bag to tables when out or secure random things to your bags (eg. hand sanitiser at the moment)
- Klean Kanteen Water bottle
- EE 4g Portable Broadband
  - Backup internet as i've had several hotels with terrible connections
- Dopp kit
  - Toothbrush / toothpaste
  - Basic first aid kit
  - Deodorant
  - Beard oil
  - Mini cologne

Packing is hard and also depends on where you're going, my current list above is based on UK summer.

But the best advice I got is, be brutal and go as lean as possible because it's easier to buy things rather than get rid of things.
