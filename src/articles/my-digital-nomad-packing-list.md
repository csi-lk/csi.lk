As some of you know my wife and I spent 6 months travelling across South East Asia while living nomadically through Airbnb's and Hostels in 2018, recently due to COVID-19 we've been forced to live nomadically in the UK due to being abandoned by the Australian Government and having our flights continuously cancelled.

Here's what i'm currently travelling with:

## Backpack

Most important part is finding a backpack that works for you, it needs to strike a balance between functionality, style and comfort.

I'm rocking the [Riut - X35 (35 litre)](https://www.riut.co.uk/collections/all-secure-riutbags-best-backpacks-2021/products/riutbag-x35-black-large-laptop-backpack) as it allows me to use it as a normal backpack day to day or as a travel bag when transiting.

## Clothes

Packed into two packing cubes and 1 shoe bag

## Misc

- Aeropress Go portable coffee maker
  - I drink too much coffee and spending Â£3 x 3 a day would bankrupt me
- Sunglasses
- Lots of carabiners
  - Helps you secure your bag to tables when out or secure random things to your bags (eg. hand sanitiser at the moment)

  - Backup internet as i've had several hotels with terrible connections

But the best advice I got is, be brutal and go as lean as possible because it's easier to buy things rather than get rid of things.
