## Goals

I feel it's important to set goals every year and keep track of them to see how you are progressing. I have a few goals that I set for myself every year, some of which are personal and some of which are professional.

### Personal

#### Buy a home ✅

- Get pre-approval for mortgage ✅

We were so happy to buy a 3 bedroom home in 2022, we had been looking for a while and finally found a place that we loved. We are now in the process of renovating the house and making it our own.

#### Get a dog ✅

We welcomed Bax into our lives early 2022, he is a Golden Retriever mixed with a Poodle (Groodle) that just turned 1 years old. He is a very energetic dog and loves to play with his toys and go for walks.

### Work

#### Be promoted to Senior Staff Engineer ✅

Which I achieved by putting a case forward with my manager then promoted while at Hopin

### Health

#### Quit drinking for Feb ✅

Ok it's the shortest month but I wanted to try quitting drinking for a period of time

#### 20 plasma donations ✅

I donate plasma fortnightly with the red cross, I have been doing this for a few years now and I still maintain is the easiest form of community service that exists, you sit in a chair, drink a milkshake and save someones life

#### Cycle 200 days ✅

I love cycling, I have am electric bike that I use to get to work and I also use it to go for rides on the weekend. I have been tracking my cycling on Strava / Apple Health and I managed to hit 200 days in 2022

#### Start weight training ✅

- Do 10 sesions with friend to learn ✅
- Sign up to gym ✅
- Start 3+ day / week routine ✅

Although I have to force myself to go to the gym most times I really enjoy watching the numbers tick up over time of the weight gains

## Video Games

I played a lot of great games this year, most of which are tracked on my [true achievements page](https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/csilk-1544)
