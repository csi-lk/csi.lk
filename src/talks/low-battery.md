- Low Battery: Why You're Always Mentally Drained (And How to Fix It)
- A talk by Callum Silcock

This presentation was written using obsidian slides which is why the markdown looks a little weird, see attached PDF output and notes of every slide.

Everything underneath "note" below are speaker notes to remind me what to talk about

note:

- Introduction - Principal Engineer at ANZ
- 15+ years building and scaling dev teams
- Today: why you feel brain dead at 3pm and what to do about it

---
![teams call](/images/low-battery/teams-call.png)

note:

Story time - Baby is coming
- October 3rd 2023
- I'm working from home and dialed into my standup at 10am with a new manager that's just started at ANZ a few weeks prior
- Why am I working from home? Because my wife is 41 weeks pregnant and due at any moment

---

note:

- She comes into the room and exclaims "I'm pretty sure i'm in labor"
- Ok, great! We have a plan for this, I do a quick brb on the call and get her to sit down on the couch and set her up
- I run back to the call and tell everyone "my baby is coming" and put the slack status on, quickly book the next 2 weeks as OOO and cancel all my meetings

---

note:

But in the time it takes me to do this suddenly I have 6 new slack notifications

- I start looking at them 
- OMG congrats!!
- Could you quickly send me the document so I can work on it while you're away 
- etc.

Hold on... this isn't important... back to the task at hand

I close the laptop go through to the other room to sit with my wife 

Ok, gotta call my Dad as I need him to pick up the dog.

note:


- Open my phone and see a wall of notifications
	- Do a quick scan
	- ummm more slack notifications
- Gotta Focus
	- Call dad

Great he's going to pick up the dog

Ok back to my wife, what do I need to do now, right

Start timing the Contractions

---

![](/images/low-battery/rate-this-app.png)

note:

I open the contraction timer app, click "start contraction" and immediately get a "Could you rate this app out of 5 stars"

The most important thing in my life was happening that day and I was consistently bombarded with things trying to steal my attention

Things getting me to switch focus

Things that ultimately didn't matter

---

![](/images/low-battery/notification-hell.png)

note:

Sound familiar?

- We're constantly being pulled away from what currently matters
	- Notifications from other applications 
	- I bet in the time i've been talking you've had a bunch of notifications already pop up
- Every buzz, ping, popup stealing our focus
- And there's a hidden cost we're not seeing

note:

# Your brain has a battery

- Think of cognitive capacity like your phone battery
- Start the day at 100%, take it off charge to wake up
- Every task drains it a little
- Sleep recharges it
- Simple, right? But here's where it gets interesting'
- It's not just WHAT you do that drains battery, it's HOW you do it

---

![](/images/low-battery/different-batteries.png)

note:
# Some brains drain faster than others

- If you're neurodivergent, especially ADHD, cognitive battery starts smaller and drains faster
- This isn't a limitation, just how your brain may work

---

![](/images/low-battery/60-percent-capacity.png)

note:

# We're all running at 60% capacity

- Research shows most professionals spend 20-40% time on meaningful work
- The rest: switching between tasks, managing interruptions, cognitive overhead
- But, It's not *just* about time
- There's a deeper problem happening in our brains

note:

# The Switching Cost Trap

- Every time you switch between tasks, brain pays cognitive tax
- Your Brain has to stop, context switch, reload new task
- Like closing one app and opening another 
	- creates a processing overhead
	- creates errors

---

![](/images/low-battery/office-distraction.png)

note:

# It's not just online

- Environmental factors also play a large part
- In the office we have
	- Physical interruptions - "shoulder tapping" - people coming to your desk
		- Cognitive drain
	- Overhear conversation? Brain needs to filter that out
		- More cognitive drain
	- And the worse, peripheral vision constantly triggered by movement
		- Like someone walks behind my monitor? 
		- Even more Cognitive drain

note:

# And it's not just in the office

- Working from home we also have forced cognitive switches
	- Seeing the laundry that you still need to put on or the dishes in the sink
	- Doorbell rings from Amazon delivering a package
	- My dog that wants to bark at everyone that walks past my house

---

![](/images/low-battery/draining-battery.png)

note:
# The compound effect

- All of these compound together
- One or two switches? No big deal
- But we're switching tens to hundreds of times per day
- Email, Slack, meetings, phone calls, different projects
- Each switch compounds
- By afternoon, cognitive battery running on fumes
- Don't know why because each individual switch felt harmless

---

![](/images/low-battery/fast-vs-slow.png)

note:
# Fast vs slow battery drain

- Focus on a single meaningful item drains our battery slower
- Deep work - when you're in flow state - barely drains battery at all
	- You can do this all day
- But responding to 12 different slack threads, or something like, I dunno, suddenly needing to do a ton of estimations and elaboration sessions? 
	- Kills your battery quick

note:
# What can I do?

- As a manager you have a major impact on your teams energy
- You can implement strategies to help them preserve their batteries

But first...

---

![](/images/low-battery/oxygen-mask.png)

note:
# First: put on your own oxygen mask

- Start with you
	- Look at your own situation first
- By implementing strategies to help your own battery, you will learn how to help your staff
- Can't preserve other people's cognitive batteries if yours is constantly dead

note:

holding slide for strategies

4 quick fixes
3 strategies

Ok... so, I'm an engineer and love giving people actionable takeaways from my talks, so, here's some immediate things to roll out

---

![](/images/low-battery/notification-triage.png)

note:
# Quick fix #1: Notification triage

- As we discussed notification is context switch
- Phone buzzes, brain automatically processes "is this important?"
- Even if don't check immediately, you've paid cognitive tax
- Be ruthless and cut those out
- Email / slack don't need real-time responses
- You can batch these into dedicated times

---

![](/images/low-battery/clean-workplace.png)

note:
# Quick fix #2: Physical workspace

- Your environment shapes your cognitive load
- In office, position yourself to minimize peripheral movement
- headphones mean "don't interrupt"
	- try messaging on slack first
- At home, dedicate space for work
	- Brain learns to associate that space with focus mode

---
![](/images/low-battery/deep-work.png)

note:

# Quick fix #3: Calendar blocking

- Most people are calendar reactive
- Let meetings fill their day, try to do real work in gaps
- Flip this
- Block time for most important work first, let meetings fill around it
- Two hours is sweet spot - long enough to get into flow, short enough to maintain energy

---

![](/images/low-battery/morning-vs-afternoon.png)

note:
# Quick fix #4: Deep vs Shallow scheduling

- Cal Newport's concept - not all work is created equal
- Deep work requires your full cognitive battery
- Shallow work can be done when running low
- Schedule accordingly
- Do most important thinking when battery is full
- Save email for when running on fumes

---

![](/images/low-battery/fixes-summary.png)

note:

Holding slide for all 4 quick fixes 

Ok lets move on to strategies

---

![](images/team-comms.png)

note:
# Strategy #1: Communication protocols

- Set a culture with your and stakeholders on communication norms
- Not everything needs immediate response
- Most "urgent" things aren't actually urgent
- Create clear protocols about what warrants interrupting someone's deep work vs what can wait

---

![](/images/low-battery/meeting-buffer.png)

note:
# Strategy #2: Meeting hygiene

- Meetings are major battery drains, especially back-to-back
- Build in transition time so brain can context switch properly
- Protect blocks of time that are meeting-free for your team
- Please have an agenda - aimless meetings are cognitive torture

---

![](/images/low-battery/daily-graph.png)

note:
# Strategy #3: Energy management

- About becoming more conscious of your cognitive state
- When are you sharpest? When do you crash?
- Plan accordingly
- Know you have demanding afternoon? Take it easier in morning
- Big presentation? Schedule recovery time after

note:

But how am I going to remember these?

---

![](/images/low-battery/tools.png)

note:
# Your toolkit

note:

- Created companion website with tools to help implement these concepts
- At link csi.lk/battery
- Includes all of the strategies i've talked about, the slides and the AI generated images

---

![](/images/low-battery/checklist-step.png)

note:
# Start tomorrow

- Don't try to implement everything at once - recipe for failure
- Pick one thing from today's talk and commit to trying it tomorrow
- Once that becomes habit, add another
- Remember, small changes compound

---

![](/images/low-battery/golden-battery.png)

note:
# Your cognitive battery is precious

- Final thought - cognitive capacity is your most valuable resource
- You don't expect your phone to last for days on end without charging
- Don't do the same with your brain
- Protect your cognitive battery, it will serve you better in everything you do
