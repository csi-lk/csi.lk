# How to get your product owners to write your functional tests

AKA Using Given / When / Then with Cypress

^ This presentation was written in Markdown for DeckSet (mac) which is why it looks a little weird, see attached PDF output and notes of every slide

^ Have been doing frontend development and trying to take the pain out of testing for >10 years now

^ Not a twitter guy

## What are we trying to solve?

^ I started a contract 4 or so years ago that had major issues with their development and deployment pipeline

^ Main goals were to decrease risk in production deployments

^ This is an evolution of that thinking to bring us to this end product

^ So lets dive in

```
  .─.                      .─.                                                      .─.

                                                  ├>Tests Pass
                                                  └>Approval

```

^ Your current workflow probably consists of ticket > dev > pr > merge > qa / staging / uat regression > production

^ Shifting your current workflow of putting QA last to putting QA first by chaining a few tools

```javascript
describe('logging in', () => {
	it('logs in, () => {
		cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/login');
		cy.get('email').type('contact@csi.lk');
		cy.get('password').type('hunter2');
		cy.get('input[type="button"]').click();
		cy.url().should('be', 'http://localhost:3000/dashboard');
	});
});
```

^ Let's start with Cypress

^ Classic login scenario, most peoples current tests look something like this

^ Visit, type in email / password, click the button, end up on the dashboard

^ instead of writing within cypress write these in feature

```feature
 Feature: Testing

   Ewww regression

   Scenario: Lack of automation
      Given I am a Frontend Developer
      When I am forced to manually test
      Then kill me
```

^ We're going to move them to a BDD approach with an old frield, cucumber

^ I know a lot of people shudder when hearing words like 'gherkins', 'cucumber' and the worst one... 'cukes' but this is quite nice, I promise

^ So if we translate our cypress scenario from before it looks like this

```feature
Feature: Logging In

  Tests the user can successfully login and log out

  Scenario: Logging In Sucessfully
    Given I am on the "login" page
    When I input my "email" as "contact@csi.lk"
    And I input my "password" as "hunter2"
    And I click the "login" button
    Then I should be on the "dashboard" page

```

^ Feature flow of login page > email > password > login button > dashboard page

^ What's up with the quotes? This is where it gets interesting, we are defining params that will be picked up in our function later

^ We are able to start defining these steps globally in a reusable way

```javascript

# Given I am on the "login" page

import { Given } from "cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps"

Given(`I am on the {string} page`, target => {
  cy.visit(`https://localhost:3000/${target.toLowerCase()}`)
})

```

^ Allows you to define a param as part of the step string which we can pass into our re-usable function

^ Let's switch tracks to a different concept now, using data attributes make it easy for chpres to taget them


```html
    <input
      type="email"
      name="email"
      placeholder="Email"
      data-qa="input-email"
    />
    <input
      type="password"
      name="password"
      placeholder="Password"
      data-qa="input-password"
    />
    <button
      data-qa="button-login"
      onClick={() => {
        setAuthentication(true)
        history.push("/dashboard")
      }}
    >
      Log In
    </button>
```

^ React, vue, jquery, mootools doesn't matter, what we're doing here is adding a specific data attribute to each input above, i'm using 'data-qa' as it's quite declarative but you can set this to whatever you like

^ You can strip your data-qa's out of your build in prod, some do (twitter) some don't (dropbox)

^ The most important thing is to make sure you have a specific format, see above I have {type} dash {name}, depending on your project you will need to define this but make sure it's consistent

```javascript
// Then the "navigation logout" button should "not" "exist"

Then(
  `the {string} button should {string} {string}`,
  (id, assert, assertion) =>
    cy
      .get(`[data-qa="${type}-${id.replace(" ", "-").toLowerCase()}"]`)
      .should(assert, assertion)
  //cy.get([data-qa="button-navigation-logout"]).should("not", "exist")
)

// Reuse!

// Then the "login" button should "be" "disabled"
```

^ This leads up the coolest part, combining the global step definitions and the data qa attributes we can do some cool shit like this

^ Allows us to reuse this over and over

^ going back to our workflow

```

^ move qa to start of pipeline

^ Using this approach allows your product owners to write the GWT scenarios in plain english, QA picks up and validates over to dev

^ Also is powerful for Bug flows

```

^ Now enabled QA to create branches of these bugs through the branch / ticket

^ dev proves bug is fixed through the functional tests

^ you can even have a validation step in there for product

^ then straight to prod!

```

^ To complete the loop publish the `.feature` files to an internal s3 bucket (or something similar) for product to know what is covered

^ Visual regression can be linked too (screenshots)

^ Cypress dashboard showing videos of the flows and screenshots, what is passing and failing

^ Gives product a overall dashboard showing what is covered, even could show build status (if you're feeling confident)

^ Ok you now understand the approach so what are the pros and cons?

## Cons

- Abstracting tests from code
- Lack of IDE tooling
- Lots of tests make for slow builds
- BDD Is hard

^ Your runner is now in the feature files rather than the code itself

^ There's no great intelligent IDE tools yet to bridge that gap

^ Having a ton of tests takes a while to run (although you can counter this by running against only what's changed and running tests across multiple runners)

^ BDD is a difficult state to get to, requires a lot of buy in from your product owners to dev to qa

^ But let's focus on the positive with Pros

## Pros

- Product owners write the tests and see the whole pipeline
- QA moves to the front of the pipeline
- Devs have less tests to write
- Less risk with deployments

^ Everyone is happy

^ Product owners can now see everything happening and the gaps they need to fill, can go to whole business

^ QA is happy as they're moving to proactive rather than reactive

^ Dev is happy because they can focus on code rather than tests

^ Lastly, less risk with production deployments as all major scnearios are covered
