Hi I’m Callum
I’m always on [Github](https://github.com/csi-lk/)
Sometimes I’m on [LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/callumsilcock)
You can contact me through [Email](mailto:contact@csi.lk)

I am currently focusing on implementing CI/CD Front End solutions
with strong UI guidelines, enabling rapid and scalable development.

I am Working Remotely for [Message Media](https://messagemedia.com.au)
I have open sourced some projects including a 
[website starter](https://github.com/csi-lk/website-starter), a [local aws ses server](https://github.com/csi-lk/aws-ses-local)
and even [this website](https://github.com/csi-lk/csi.lk)
