![Low Battery: Why You're Always Mentally Drained (And How to Fix It)](/images/low-battery/title.png)

Your cognitive battery is your most valuable resource. Here are immediate actions and long-term strategies to help preserve and manage your mental energy throughout the day.

## The Problem

Most professionals spend only 20-40% of their time on meaningful work. The rest is lost to task switching, managing interruptions, and cognitive overhead. Every time you switch between tasks, your brain pays a cognitive tax - like closing one app and opening another, it creates processing overhead and errors.

## 4 Quick Fixes (Start Today)

### 1. Notification Triage
**Problem**: Every notification is a context switch that drains cognitive battery, even if you don't check it immediately.

**Action**: 
- Turn off non-essential notifications on phone and computer
- Email and Slack don't need real-time responses
- Batch check messages at dedicated times (e.g., 9am, 1pm, 4pm)
- Use "Do Not Disturb" modes liberally

### 2. Physical Workspace
**Problem**: Your environment constantly demands cognitive resources to filter out distractions.

**Action**:
- **In office**: Position yourself to minimize peripheral movement, use headphones to signal "don't interrupt"
- **At home**: Dedicate a specific space for work so your brain associates it with focus mode
- Clear visual distractions from your workspace

### 3. Calendar Blocking
**Problem**: Most people are calendar reactive - letting meetings fill their day and trying to do real work in the gaps.

**Action**:
- Block time for your most important work FIRST
- Let meetings fill around your deep work blocks
- Aim for 2-hour blocks (long enough for flow state, short enough to maintain energy)
- Protect your calendar like you'd protect your most valuable resource

### 4. Deep vs Shallow Scheduling
**Problem**: Trying to do high-cognitive work when your battery is already drained.

**Action**:
- Schedule your most important thinking work when your battery is full (usually mornings)
- Save low-cognitive tasks (email, admin work) for when you're running on fumes
- Match task difficulty to your current energy level

## 3 Long-Term Strategies

### 1. Communication Protocols
**Goal**: Reduce unnecessary cognitive interruptions across your team.

**Implementation**:
- Establish clear communication norms with your team and stakeholders
- Define what constitutes "urgent" vs "can wait"
- Create protocols for when it's okay to interrupt deep work
- Most "urgent" things aren't actually urgent - question the default

### 2. Meeting Hygiene
**Goal**: Minimize the cognitive drain from poorly managed meetings.

**Implementation**:
- Build transition time between meetings for proper context switching
- Protect meeting-free blocks for your team's deep work
- Always have an agenda - aimless meetings are cognitive torture
- Consider if this meeting could be an async message instead

### 3. Energy Management
**Goal**: Become conscious of your cognitive patterns and plan accordingly.

**Implementation**:
- Track when you're sharpest vs when you crash
- Plan demanding work during your peak hours
- Schedule recovery time after big presentations or intense work
- Know your limits and respect them

## Remember

- **Don't try to implement everything at once** - pick one thing and make it a habit first
- **Small changes compound** - consistency beats intensity
- **Your cognitive battery is precious** - protect it like you would any valuable resource
- **You wouldn't expect your phone to last days without charging** - don't expect the same from your brain
