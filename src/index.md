Hi I’m Callum and...

{% BigText %}I lead front end architectural change for scalability{% endBigText %}

I have been a Front End Developer for 10+ years now running my own business [⠺⠑⠃webanytime](https://webanyti.me) in London.

I occasionally write long blogs and micro blogs, I have a lot of code open sourced and have a interactive professional timeline so you can get to know me.
